      As insufficient as we human beings are, we are proud. God has always
      wanted man to live the kind of life he lives. He has always wanted us to
      live by the life He lives; to all have eternal life. To be forever joined
      with Him, the source of life.
      <br />
      <br />
      God made all things, and this means the created things are obviously in
      need, as they couldnâ€™t create themselves. God made trees to satisfy man
      and food for him to eat. And much more, He made you.
      <br />
      <br />
      He is not against the disbelief you might have developed over the years,
      but you not accepting the fact that God is what you need, is to your own
      loss.
      <br />
      <br />
      Thereâ€™s so much to experience in Christ Jesus, the joy he gives, the life
      and satisfaction he gives you in the midst of this world where nothing
      satisfies, but Jesus can satisfy.
      <br />
      <br />
      Even your name: EbunifeOluwaâ€¦ testifies that thereâ€™s a God, and the thing
      is, maybe because you read the Bible completely sometime ago and you were
      confused, I donâ€™t know. Then you gave up maybe.
      <br />
      <br />
      You should not let your past define your future sir!!!
      <br />
      <br />
      Thereâ€™s a supernatural life, Tony, and thatâ€™s what God wants us all to
      live in and to take action on the earth by. A life above anxiety attacks,
      worries and other things.
      <br />
      <br />
      Your gifts can reach the world, but you canâ€™t go far without the
      sponsorship of the Most High.
      <br />
      <br />
      The supernatural actually exists, Spirits and demons and those evil things
      existâ€¦ Angels existâ€¦ Even other Religions agree. But Christianity isnâ€™t
      religion, itâ€™s life. Itâ€™s where true life is found.
      <br />
      <br />
      This is Salvation: It is when One is finally joined to the One who made
      Him, and Knows him in and out. God that made you, knows why He did and in
      salvation you become one with Him. A perfect combo on the earth. Empowered
      to reign above all that life would throw at you.
      <br />
      <br />
      The fact that you might not agree to something, doesnâ€™t mean it isnâ€™t
      real. A man can have a bullet-proof vestâ€¦but Him thinking that the vest
      makes him indestructible, is going to lead him to his death by grenade or
      something stronger eventually.
      <br />
      <br />
      The devil is real. And He hates everyone and everything, and sometimes we
      might think we are just being stubborn, without knowing that the devil
      speaks in persuasions to our minds, purposely blinding our minds from
      seeing the truth. Thatâ€™s why right now, I believe as youâ€™re reading this,
      thereâ€™s a persuasion going on in your mind, by another Spirit, the Holy
      Ghost, God Himself.
      <br />
      <br />
      I know you might have questions, I know you might have been disappointed,
      but God is never the source of our problems but always the solution. He
      is.
      <br />
      <br />
      Please, I want you to begin to be honest with yourself and your
      convictions because one day life would test you. Open up your heart and
      receive Godâ€™s love and grace afreshâ€¦God is not counting your faults
      against you, Christ Jesus has paid for your sins alreadyâ€¦open your heart..
      <br />
      <br />
      Then all these things you might not have understood before would begin to
      make sense, because only Godâ€™s child can understand the things of God.
      Iâ€™ll keep on praying for you Tony. But this is the Honest truth.
      <br />
      <br />
      Pride can do more harm than you think. I also want to send you a sermon
      series, so you can understand more. God loves you. Merry Christmas TonyðŸŽ„.
      <br />
      <br />
      You are blessed!!!
